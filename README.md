# Large-ScaleLog-Analysis-Anamaly-Detection
Developed a PySpark-based data pipeline to process data over of synthetic system logs for performance and security analysis. Implemented statistical anomaly detection to identify hourly spikes in ERROR/CRITICAL logs, uncovering over 250 critical anomalies indicating potential system instability and intrusion attempts.
